This answer can change week to week. I think it is a wide open race to the Super Bowl. This Sunday's game between Green Bay and Philadelphia features the two best teams in the NFC at this point, in my opinion.
Looking at the other conference powers ... Even with the injury to Carson Palmer, Arizona will still be tough. The defense is stout,
and Drew Stanton will do a solid job at QB -- but the lack of a consistent run game will eventually hurt the Cards. The Seahawks might be getting into a groove with their running game -- and they still have two games apiece against the Cardinals and 49ers, which could allow Seattle to re-establish itself as a true juggernaut. The 49ers will be tough because of their steady play on defense, but they still have no consistency on offense. Detroit's defense is excellent, but the Lions' offense continues to leave something to be desired.
Meanwhile, Philly and Green Bay have been fairly consistent on offense all year. I'd put the Eagles' defense slightly ahead of Green Bay's unit. Thus, today, I believe Philadelphia is the best team in the NFC. Next week? Who knows. My app keeps on crashing when I upgrade to ios 7.1.2
