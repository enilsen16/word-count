This used to be everyone's favorite app, but now it's getting crappier each update. For 1) each new stupid feature you add, the more bugs and crashing that keep coming with it. I have to relog in every time now and that never used to happen and it shuts down. 2) it was so popular because of how it was, so why on earth you would change it is beyond me. So get rid of the discover and sending money crap, no one cares nor uses it, it's a waste of time and space. 3) Also make the live thing optional on our settings, it's a cool idea sometimes, but it gets annoying quickly. 4) make it simple again, the reason so many people liked it was because it was so simple, and each update you continue to make it more complex and harder for everyone to use. That's why everyone's drifting away and giving up. Finally and most importantly, I don't know how many terrible reviews and people can say this before you get the hint: BRING BACK THE BEST FRIENDS LIST! Who cares about the stalker girlfriends or whatever else, it was cool and everyone enjoyed it. It also helped find mutual friends that aren't in your address book. This new emoji thing to tell if you have mutual friends is stupid and it's not the same. If you want to ever get the popularity and good ratings back before it's too late, the ONLY way it's going to happen is by bringing back the friends list.
